This is a photo uploader and JSON API generator custom built for Iron Yard's hackathon. It creates/updates API every time a new photo/file is added. The API was successfully accessed and used by iOS developers to automatically update their iOS app with the new photos/files that were added.

==== Main technologies used:

* bldr gem to generate JSON API for iOS developers to access
* Paperclip gem (to upload files)
* aws-sdk gem to interact with Amazon S3 Web Services API (to store files)
